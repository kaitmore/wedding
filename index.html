          <p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>
		  <p>It’s incredible how much can change in a year! I know so many of your lives have changed, and ours did too in a big way. In July, we moved from our rowhouse tucked in Capitol Hill to our 5 acre home outside of Asheville and we thought, we need to get married here! We needed some time to get settled in so we decided to wait for the Spring flowers. 		</p>
			<p>Our new wedding date is April 30th, a date we sincerely hope will not change again! We do ask that everyone is fully vaccinated by the wedding to make sure we are all as safe as can be. We still plan on keeping the event at under 50 people. </p>
			<p>There will be delicious food, beautiful wine and warm company. Throw in some cute goats, chickens, a beautiful garden and some of the local craft beers too! Come dressed in your best colors. Musicians, bring your instruments if you’d like!</p>
			<p>Asheville is visited by 10 million vacationers every year and is an awesome place to experience an incredible food scene, the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the clear air. We hope you will love it as much as we do here!</p>
			<p>Much love,<br />
		      Alexandra and Kait</p>
